## Day 1 — Blackjack Project Completion  
**Date:** 2025-11-07  

### What I Accomplished  
- Completed my first full Python project — an object-oriented Blackjack game.  
- Built multiple classes (`Card`, `Deck`, `Hand`, `Game`) and learned how they interact.  
- Improved understanding of how data flows between class instances.  
- Practiced using loops and conditionals to manage user input, dealer logic, and outcomes.  
- Added basic text formatting to improve user experience.

### What I Learned / Reinforced  
- The difference between `.extend()` and `.append()` when working with lists.  
- How nested loops help construct data structures (like a deck of cards).  
- How “sub‑optimal” practice code builds intuition before optimizing.  
- How structure and design matter just as much as syntax.

### What Was Challenging  
- Tracking variables across multiple classes.  
- Handling Ace logic correctly in Blackjack scoring.  
- Understanding how to design program flow before writing code.

### Reflections  
- I can now follow and understand the structure of a real program, even if I can’t yet build something this large from scratch.  
- Guided practice is helping me move toward independence — this is stage 2 of fluency.  
- Writing code for several hours reinforced patience and careful reading.

### Next Steps (Planned for Day 2)  
- Refactor `blackjack.py` for cleaner logic.  
- Improve Ace-handling logic.  
- Separate display from game logic for better structure.  
- Push initial work to GitHub.

## Day 3 — Dice Game Project Completion  
**Date:** 2025-11-??  

### Summary of Today’s Work  
Today I completed my second full Python project: the Dice Game. This project strengthened my understanding of object‑oriented programming and helped me learn how to structure a small, complete program on my own.

I created multiple classes (`Die`, `Player`, `Game`), managed state, handled user input, and implemented a clean game loop. This project clarified the differences between class and instance variables and improved my confidence in reading and writing multi‑class programs.

### Concepts Strengthened  
- Object-oriented design  
- Separation of concerns between classes  
- Using nested `while` loops properly  
- Validating user input safely  
- Persistent state (scores, round count)  
- Basic game loop architecture  
- Using Black for auto-formatting  
- Understanding Git tracking and ignoring files correctly  

### Key Takeaways  
- Persistent state belongs inside class instances, not in the game loop.  
- Breaking out of nested loops makes more sense now.  
- Class attributes vs. instance attributes is now much clearer.  
- Formatting tools like Black drastically improve code readability.  
- A good `.gitignore` prevents bad commits (e.g., `.vscode/`, `venv`, cache folders).

### Next Steps  
- Commit the Dice Game to GitHub using clean commit practices.  
- Move on to the next roadmap task (Week 1 — Day 3).  
- Continue strengthening skills by writing more small projects independently.

## Day 1 — Blackjack Project Completion
**Date:** 2025-11-07  

**What I accomplished:**  
- Completed my first full Python project — an object-oriented Blackjack game.  
- Practiced building multiple classes (`Card`, `Deck`, `Hand`, `Game`) and connecting them together.  
- Learned how data flows between class instances and how methods encapsulate logic.  
- Used control flow (loops, conditionals) to manage user input, dealer behavior, and win conditions.  
- Added humor and readable text formatting to improve user experience.

**What I learned / reinforced:**  
- The difference between `.extend()` and `.append()` when managing lists of objects.  
- How to use nested loops to populate data structures (deck of cards).  
- That “sub-optimal” code for practice helps solidify logic before optimizing.  
- Understanding code structure is the bridge between following tutorials and writing independently.

**What was challenging:**  
- Managing inter-class communication and keeping track of where each variable lived.  
- Handling Ace values correctly in scoring logic.  
- Understanding how to design a program’s structure, not just its syntax.

**Reflections:**  
- I can now follow and understand the structure of a real program, even if I couldn’t yet build it entirely from scratch.  
- The guided practice is building the foundation for independence — this is stage 2 of fluency.  
- Coding this for several hours taught me patience and the importance of reading my own code carefully.

**Next steps (Day 2 goals):**  
- Refactor `blackjack.py` for cleaner logic and ace handling.  
- Separate display/logic layers for scalability.  
- Add a score tracker across games.  
- Push all work to GitHub and keep documenting progress.
